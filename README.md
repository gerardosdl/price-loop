# Price Loop

Price Loop is a web app that lets users add items and track prices across stores and locations. Users can share price entries, add notes, edit item details, and maintain a personal list of tracked items. The app includes basic filtering and sorting tools, making it easier to organize data. It’s designed for communities to monitor prices collectively — useful in informal markets or small business settings.
